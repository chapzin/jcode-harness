# Embedded Skills Harness Status

This checklist tracks the fork proposal described in `docs/SKILLS_HARNESS.md` and `docs/CODEX_BOOTSTRAP.md`.

## Proposal pillars

| Pillar | Status | Evidence | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offline built-in skills | Done | `src/skill_pack.rs` embeds `karpathy-guidelines`, `optimization`, `clean-code-guardian`, and `llmwiki-memory` with `include_str!`; unit tests assert all built-ins parse; e2e coverage asserts `skills doctor` duplicate reporting. | Keep duplicate reporting deterministic as new origins are added. |
| Deterministic skill source priority | Done | `src/skill.rs` loads built-ins, `.claude/skills`, `~/.jcode/skills`, then project `.jcode/skills`; unit tests cover built-in, Claude compat, and project-local override precedence; e2e coverage verifies isolated global precedence via `JCODE_HOME`. | Keep precedence docs and tests in lockstep with any new source. |
| Skills CLI | Done | `jcode skills list/show/sync/doctor` and `jcode-harness skills ...` are wired through `src/cli/commands.rs` and `src/bin/harness.rs`; e2e tests cover list, show, sync, doctor, duplicate reporting, JSON output, and closed stdout pipe behavior. | Keep JSON schema stable and add fields only in backward-compatible ways. |
| Clean Code quality gate | Done | `src/clean_code.rs`, `.jcode/quality/clean-code-rules.yaml`, and `clean-code check/rules`; unit tests cover file/function thresholds, long lines, silent error patterns, allow comments, skipped dirs, unsupported files, and path deduplication; e2e tests cover JSON, rules YAML, and fail-on behavior. | Expand fixtures alongside any new heuristic rule. |
| `jcode-harness run` | Done | `src/bin/harness.rs` delegates to provider init, `Registry::new`, and `Agent` runtime, with JSON/NDJSON/dry-run modes; e2e dry-run tests cover skill preface selection; `--mock-response` e2e tests cover JSON/NDJSON without network credentials. | Add live-provider smoke only as an opt-in integration test. |
| `/init` swarm bootstrap | Done | `/init` writes deterministic scaffold files, queues an LLM-driven swarm analysis prompt by default, requires parallel discovery roles, and blocks synthesis on an await/report barrier; tests cover default swarm queueing, `--no-swarm`, invalid usage, and generated swarm analysis files. | Add end-to-end live TUI/provider smoke when UI automation can verify full swarm completion. |
| Deterministic skill router | Done | `src/skill_router.rs` supports `auto`, `off`, `always`, explicit skills, coding terms, perf terms, and LLM wiki/project-memory terms, with unit and CLI dry-run coverage for proposal guarantees. | Keep trigger vocabulary conservative and test every expansion. |
| Repo/task skill scoping preview | Done | `jcode-harness skills match <goal>` previews selected skills without provider calls, preserves explicit task-level skills first, resolves repo-local overrides via `--cwd`, and emits JSON for automation. | Extend only with backward-compatible fields and keep router order deterministic. |
| Harness smoke | Done | `jcode-harness smoke` executes deterministic tool cases without model calls. | Add CI-friendly smoke assertion or e2e wrapper. |
| LLM wiki memory integration | Partial | `llmwiki-memory` is an embedded skill that documents safe local LLM wiki MCP usage for durable project memory, provenance, transcript sync, and secret boundaries; router auto-selects it for wiki/context-history tasks. | Add deeper CLI/MCP integration only after permission and credential-boundary review. |
| Documentation and discoverability | Partial | README, `docs/SKILLS_HARNESS.md`, `docs/CODEX_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `docs/JCODE_HARNESS_PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, `docs/JCODE_HARNESS_RELEASE_GATES.md`, `docs/JCODE_HARNESS_JSON_SCHEMAS.md`, `docs/JCODE_HARNESS_INIT_SWARM.md`, and `.jcode/SKILLS_PLAN.md`. | Keep this status checklist updated after each implementation slice. |

## Next implementation slices

1. Add permission-reviewed bridge points between `llmwiki-memory` and concrete wiki commands without making remote MCP/network dependencies mandatory.
2. Add opt-in live-provider integration smoke for `jcode-harness run` with strict credential isolation.
3. Add release-note template for upstream divergence and harness-specific behavior.
4. Continue expanding stable JSON schema docs as automation contracts expand.
